/**
 Program : Write a Java program to find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence from a given unsorted array of integers.
           Sample array: [49, 1, 3, 200, 2, 4, 70, 5]
           The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], therefore the program will return its length 5.
